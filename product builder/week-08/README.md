# Week 8 — Cloud-Native Scaling (AWS)

Phase: Data Engineering & Cloud Scaling (Days 31–60)

Focus: AWS services for data & serverless

Concepts
- S3 for data lakes and lifecycle policies
- AWS Lambda for serverless processing and triggers
- RDS management, backups, and maintenance patterns

Mini-Project
- Build an auto-scaling image processor: upload to S3 → trigger Lambda → persist metadata to RDS.

Skill Practice
- Manage AWS IAM permissions for least-privilege access and secure resource access patterns.
