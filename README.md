📅 Curriculum Roadmap
Phase 1: Full-Stack Core (Days 1 - 30)
Focuses on type-safe architectures, state management, and robust API design.
 * Key Highlights: TS Utility Types, React Performance, Nest.js Dependency Injection, GraphQL N+1 optimization.
 * Capstone 1: A Full-Stack application featuring a REST/GraphQL hybrid API.
Phase 2: Data Engineering (Days 31 - 60)
Transitioning into high-volume data processing and storage strategies.
 * Key Highlights: Advanced SQL (CTEs/Windows), ETL/ELT Pipelines, Star/Snowflake Schemas, Big Data (Spark).
 * Capstone 2: An End-to-End Data Pipeline (API ➝ Cleaning ➝ Transformation ➝ Dashboard).
Phase 3: Cloud & Performance (Days 61 - 90)
Scaling applications and automating deployment workflows.
 * Key Highlights: Containerization (Docker/K8s), Serverless, CI/CD Pipelines, Microservices, and Messaging Queues.
 * Capstone 3: A Cloud-Native Scalable Product deployed 

📈 Learning Philosophy
> Stop learning for nothing. Learn to build things for real "users" and "customers". Essential concepts first, expert later.
